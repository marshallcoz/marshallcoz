## Marcial Alberto Contreras Zazueta ##

I have had the opportunity to focus my career on the liaison between
civil engineering, advanced numerical methods and software
development. I also believe innovation and capacity building are key for
a sustainable business, this is why I have always share what I know and
accept advice with gratitude. My interests range from
building instrumentation and vibration and strong motion based structural
health monitoring, to machine learning, computer vision and algorithm development.
I have experience with elastic wave propagation
modeling for the evaluation of machine induced vibration and human
comfort control, machine learning, geomatics, GIS and automation
application development.
